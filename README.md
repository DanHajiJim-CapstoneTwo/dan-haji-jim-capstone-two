My first group collaboration and second capstone project as part of the DI/AMEX Coding Bootcamp that demonstrated our continuing knowledge of React.

# PokeProducts

PokeProducts is a web based service that allows you to peruse the first 151 Pokemon ever created and catch, level up, and purchase a series of new companions to add to your collection.

At affordable prices, you, too, can have the satisfaction of catching them all.

## More About The Project

PokeProducts is built using the create-react-app developer environment. The primary language used is React, and it incorporates the Axios library as well.

You will also find custom CSS paired with our individual components.

_This is a part of an AMEX sponsored Learn-to-Code Bootcamp capstone project, illustrating the skills learned thus far by our team._

## Team Blue Barracudas

Team Blue Barracudas is comprised of three developers:

- Dan Liebman
- Haji Russell
- Jim Liriano

Team Blue Barracudas employed a number of strategies throughout the life of the project, up to and including: pair-coding, continued research outside of business hours, working on seperate branches of the project, and individual Component handling.

## See the Project for Yourself Locally

If you are interested in seeing and interracting with this project locally, you can fork the repo through GitHub's functionality and further clone from your own repository to your machine locally.

Run npm-start to open the app in a local port (typically port 3000)!

Have fun taking a peek under the hood!
